# Preface {.unnumbered}

The book is intended as documentation on on a suggested pipeline for normalizing brain and lesion masks from chronic stroke T1 weighted imaging.

This pipeline was comprised as part of my exchange stay at the Brain Behaviour Lab at UBC, Vancouver, Canada. It is my hope that the notes and script may be of help to others, myself being a new learner to FSL and everything around it.

The reason for creating this tool is to use 1mm MNI normalised lesion masks for the [NeMo tool](https://kuceyeski-wcm-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/upload.html).

Most of the hard working scripts in this pipeline are based on the work by [Dr. Dianne Patterson, PhD](https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). I have tried my best at modifying the original scripts as little as possible for clarity, and instead created a few new scripts to work as wrappers.

And then, the. frustration. I found that documentation for this work was highly lacking, and I've had to rely on other people doing the documentation. As an example, [this is the best overview of `fslmaths -help`](https://mandymejia.com/fsl-maths-commands/). And please notice, that to get help for `fslmaths`or `flirt`, type the command followed by `-help`. If you want the same from `fnirt`, then type `-h` or `--help` as is the case for most other command-line programs.

Then one could argue, that this is just another second hand documentation. Yes, that is true. But it is also and attempt to lower the step into working with MRI data.
