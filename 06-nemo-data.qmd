# ZIP to data set

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
source("glossary_setup.R")
```

So, here I'll show how we went from compressed zip file, from the NeMo tool, and to having a data set for further analyses.

I am fairly new to Python, but have worked in R for many years. This means, that I have written just enough in Python, and everything else in R. Small python functions will be wrapped in R scripts. Just a word of warning.

First, extract the compressed file and put it where you like. I'll denote this location as the `source.folder`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# source.folder <- "/full/path/NeMo_output"
source.folder <- "/Users/au301842/NeMo_output"
```

Then we want to extract the `chacovol` data. This is extracted by unpikling `.pkl` files using a short python script wrapped in R:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
source("nemo/unpkl-sparse.R")
unpkl_sparse(data.folder = source.folder,
             "chacovol_yeo17_mean.pkl")
```

The unpikled files are then collected and merged in a wide format.

But first, we need to handle the provided atlas `.txt` files to get ROI names:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| comment: This got unneccessarily complicated due to the fixed width format of the provided atlas file. Sure you can do better!
atlas <- readLines("/Users/au301842/NeMo_output/Yeo2011_17Networks_NetworkNames_ColorLUT.txt")
rois <- do.call(c,lapply(atlas[-1],function(i){
  s1 <- strsplit(i,"_[0-9]{1,3}_")[[1]][2]
  strsplit(s1," ")[[1]][1]
  }
  ))
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
source("nemo/nemo-collect.R")
df <- nemo_collect(
  data.folder = source.folder,
  id.pattern = "W[0-9]{2}",
  file.pattern = "chacovol_yeo17_mean.tsv",
  roi.names = rois
)
```

I very much prefer writing function to do the data handling, but I just have to note, that these functions are very primitive due to lack of time on my end. But they are working and will provide a good foundation for further worker.

We also want those nice glass brains. These following R scripts are all simple wrappers for the scripts from the NeMo tool, which uses the `nibabel` Python package for plotting. All the examples below are created based on a small sample of two subjects and the [Yeo17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21653723/) atlas which is also [shared in the NeMo tool source](https://github.com/kjamison/nemo/tree/master/website/atlases).

First we do the simpel voxel based heatmap.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
source("nemo/glass-brain.R")
glass_brain(
  data.folder = source.folder,
  file.pattern = "chacovol_res2mm_mean.nii.gz",
  out.name = "images/glass_chacovol.png"
)
```

![Averaged voxel based chacovol glassbrain plot](images/glass_chacovol.png){fig-align="center"} Next we can do the parcellation or atlas based chacovol plotting:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
source("nemo/glass-brain.R")
glass_brain(
  data.folder = source.folder,
  file.pattern = "chacovol_yeo17_mean.pkl",
  out.name = "images/glass_chacovol_parc.png",
  parcellation = "/Users/atlas/folder/Yeo2011_17Networks_MNI152_182x218x182_LiberalMask.nii.gz"
)
```

The same scirpt can also be used for lesion plotting:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
glass_brain(
  data.folder = "/Users/folder/with/lesions/",
  file.pattern = "lesion.nii.gz",
  id.pattern = "W(50|49)", # This id.pattern is used to only include specified ids
  out.name = "images/glass_lesion.png"
)
```

![Combined lesion plot](images/glass_lesion.png){fig-align="center"}

And finally the change in connections between areas in the brain can be visualised as a graphbrain:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
source("nemo/graph-brain.R")
graph_brain(
  data.folder = source.folder,
  file.pattern = "chacoconn_yeo17_mean.pkl",
  out.name = "images/glass_chacoconn.png",
  node.file="/Users/atlas/folder/Yeo2011_17Networks_MNI152_182x218x182_LiberalMask.nii.gz"
)
```

## Glossary

```{r}
#| echo: false
glossary::glossary_table()
```
