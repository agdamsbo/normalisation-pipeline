Coding is very much inspired and copied from other sources. I will try to write sources and inspiration.\n\n## Package and upload\n\nFirst step is to get the normalised lesion masks processed by the <a class='glossary' title='Network Modification tool. https://github.com/kjamison/nemo'>NeMo</a> tool to get a \"dis-<a class='glossary' title='Term used to denote the collection of connections in the brain.'>connectome</a>\".\n\nThe online instance of the tool offers to freely process lesion masks in batches of 10. You can use the bundled *R*-script to package lesion masks into compressed zip-batches of maximum 10.\n\n1.  Open the `nemo_packing.R` file and edit the variables in the first section, then run the script, from either RStudio or the command terminal window:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.bash .cell-code}\n    Rscript nemo-packing.R\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n1.  Then head over to the [NeMo processing website](https://kuceyeski-wcm-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/upload.html) and upload the zip-files, one at a time with your desired settings and atlas for parcellation.\n\n## Glossary\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> definition </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> connectome </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Term used to denote the collection of connections in the brain. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> NeMo </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Network Modification tool. https://github.com/kjamison/nemo </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::",
