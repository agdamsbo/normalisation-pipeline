This was the command used to perform fsl based registration to 1 mm MNI standard space:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nsh /codes/folder/00norm_pipeline.sh --do1mm\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n1.  Now you should be ready to package for the NeMo tool. The web interface has an upload limit of 10 lesion masks. Open and edit the source-folder in the `nemo-packing.R` script. It will collect all 1mm MNI lesion masks and package in zip-files of max 10 lesion masks each and put them in the provided folder. Save and then run the following:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.bash .cell-code}\n    Rscript nemo-packing.R\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\nThen files were uploaded and sent to the [NeMo tool server]().\n\n## Glossary\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglossary_table()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ndata frame with 0 columns and 0 rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
