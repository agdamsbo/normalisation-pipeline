This means, that I have written just enough in Python, and everything else in R. Small python functions will be wrapped in R scripts. Just a word of warning.\n\nFirst, extract the compressed file and put it where you like. I'll denote this location as the `source.folder`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThen we want to extract the `chacovol` data. This is extracted by unpikling `.pkl` files using a short python script wrapped in R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe unpikled files are then collected and merged in a wide format.\n\nBut first, we need to handle the provided atlas `.txt` files to get ROI names:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nI very much prefer writing function to do the data handling, but I just have to note, that these functions are very primitive due to lack of time on my end. But they are working and will provide a good foundation for further worker.\n\n## Visualisation\n\nWe also want those nice glass brains. This is entirely based on the scripts from the NeMo tool, which uses the `nibabel` Python package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![Averaged chacovol glassbrain plot](images/glass_chacovol.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nThe same scirpt can also be used for lesion plotting:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![Combined lesion plot](images/glass_lesion.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
