To make it a bid more widely useful, the pipeline documented here will register T1 weighted images to either 1 or 2 mm MNI standard space and include a lesion mask in that process, if any is present.\n\nThe pipeline was comprised as part of my exchange stay at the Brain Behaviour Lab at UBC, Vancouver, Canada during August-October 2023. It is my hope that the notes and scripts may be of help to others, myself being a new learner to FSL and everything around it.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe reason for creating this tool is to use 1mm MNI normalised lesion masks for the [NeMo tool](https://kuceyeski-wcm-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/upload.html).\n\nMost of the hard working scripts in this pipeline are based on the work by [Dr. Dianne Patterson, PhD](https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which in turn is also based on others work. I have tried my best at modifying the original scripts as little as possible for clarity, and instead created a few new scripts to work as wrappers.\n\nAnd then, the frustration. I found that documentation that is easy to understand is highly lacking in the field (or I just didn't manage to find it). Also, the documentation on fsl-functions is difficult to always follow.As an example, [this is the best overview of `fslmaths -help`](https://mandymejia.com/fsl-maths-commands/). And please notice, that to get help for `fslmaths`or `flirt`, type the command followed by `-help`. If you want the same from `fnirt`, then type `-h` or `--help` as is the case for most other command-line programs.\n\nI have tried to lower the bar to get started working on MRI registration.
