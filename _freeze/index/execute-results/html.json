To make it a bid more widely useful, the pipeline documented here will register T1 weighted images to either 1 or 2 mm MNI standard space and include a lesion mask in that process, if any is present.\n\nThe pipeline was comprised as part of my exchange stay at the Brain Behaviour Lab at UBC, Vancouver, Canada during August-October 2023. It is my hope that the notes and scripts may be of help to others, myself being a new learner to FSL and everything around it.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe reason for creating this tool is to use 1mm <a class='glossary' title='Montreal Neurological Institute. https://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/atlases/'>MNI</a> normalised (<a class='glossary' title='I this context, registration denotes to art of registrering to normal space. In this case to the MNI space. Think of it as normalising data.'>registration</a>) lesion masks for the [<a class='glossary' title='Network Modification tool. https://github.com/kjamison/nemo'>NeMo</a> tool](https://kuceyeski-wcm-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/upload.html).\n\nMost of the hard working scripts in this <a class='glossary' title='A set of tools working together as chain links being dependent on one-another. Just a fancy term for “ordered collection”'>pipeline</a> are based on the work by [Dr. Dianne Patterson, PhD](https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which in turn is also based on others work. I have tried my best at modifying the original scripts as little as possible for clarity, and instead created a few new scripts to work as wrappers.\n\nAnd then, the frustration. I found that documentation that is easy to understand is highly lacking in the field (or I just didn't manage to find it). Also, the documentation on <a class='glossary' title='Thes picture viewing tool from the fsl-package. https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes'>fsl</a>-functions is difficult to always follow. As an example, [this is the best overview of `fslmaths -help`](https://mandymejia.com/fsl-maths-commands/). And please notice, that to get help for `fslmaths`or `flirt`, type the command followed by `-help`. If you want the same from `fnirt`, then type `-h` or `--help` as is the case for most other command-line programs.\n\nI have tried to lower the bar to get started working on <a class='glossary' title='Magnetic Resonance Imaging'>MRI</a> <a class='glossary' title='I this context, registration denotes to art of registrering to normal space. In this case to the MNI space. Think of it as normalising data.'>registration</a>.
