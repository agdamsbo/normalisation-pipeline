The `r glossary("pipeline")` provides a set of handy tools listed below, which I will also go through:

-   *R*-script to organise files into subject-folders

-   `r glossary("Bash")` pipeline to process all subject folders to extract brain mask, and normalise lesion mask to 1 mm MNI space (this is the primary content)

-   `r glossary("Bash")`-script to normalise lesion mask after manual correction of brain mask (no, even using `r glossary("optiBET")` is not perfect)

-   *R*-script to package lesion masks to supply to the NeMo tool.
